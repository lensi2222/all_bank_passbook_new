It is calculated as follows:\n Year 1:\n - 1000 x (0.04) = 40\n - Reduced Pension = 1000 - 40 = 960\n Year 2:\n - 960 x 0.04 = 38.4\n - Reduced Pension = 960 - 38.4 = 921.60.\n3) Permanent and Total disability:\n - Employees who are unable to work due to permanent and total disability during the service.\n4) Death of employee:\n - Employee's family is eligible for a pension when the employee dies.",
  "- The pensionable service is determined by the number of years the employer contributed to the employee's EPF.\n- If your employer did not deposit the contribution amount for certain months, then such months are not considered for the calculation of service.\n- If an employee reaches 58 years of age and has completed 20 years of service or more, his pensionable service will be increased by 2 years for calculation purposes.\n- For calculation purposes, if your service is more than or equal to 6 months, then it will be rounded off to one year. If the service is less than 6 months, then such a fraction of the service period is not considered.\n- For example, if you worked for 25 years and 8 months, your service will be considered as 26 years. But, if your service is 25 years and 3 months, then service will be considered as 25 years only.\n- A maximum of 35 years will be considered for calculation purposes, even if you have served for more than 35 years.",
  "- Pensionable salary is the average of the last 12 months' Basic Pay + DA immediately before retirement.\nA maximum of Rs. 15,000/- will be considered as a pensionable salary for calculation purposes, even if it is more than Rs. 15,000/-.",
  "There are 2 methods to calculate monthly pension, based on whether the employee joined EPF before or after 15-Nov-1995.\n1) Employees joined before 15-Nov-1995:\n- This is calculated based on PastServicePensionandPensionableSalaryPensioncomponents. Also, this pension is a part ofFamilyPensionScheme(FPS)\n2) Employees joined after 15-Nov-1995:\n- Monthly pension is calculated using the following formula:\n Monthly pension = (pensionable salary x pensionable service) / 70.\n- Pensionable salary is the average of the last 12 months' Basic pay + DA immediately before retirement. A maximum of Rs. 15,000/- will be considered for calculation purposes.\n- Pensionable service is the number of years of service. A maximum of 35 years will be considered.",
  "Minimum pension available under EPS scheme is Rs. 1,000/-.\nFrom the financial year 2014-15, the government has fixed the minimum monthly pension benefit as Rs. 1,000/-.\nMaximum pension an employee can get under this scheme is calculated as shown below:\n= (15000 x 35) / 70\n= Rs. 7,500.\nMaximum pension amount is Rs. 7,500/-.",
  "You can withdraw the amount in EPS, but your total service should be less than 9 years and 6 months.\nOnce you complete 9 years and 6 months of service, then you can't withdraw EPS amount.\nEven if you are eligible, you still can't withdraw the entire balance in EPS. You can withdraw only a certain portion of it.\nThe withdrawal amount depends on the number of years of service and your monthly basic pay + DA components.\nThe below table provides the proportion for withdrawal:\n- 1 year - 1.02 times\n- 2 years - 1.99 times\n- 3 years - 2.98 times \n- 4 years - 3.99 times\n- 5 years - 5.02 times\n- 6 years - 6.07 times\n- 7 years - 7.13 times\n- 8 years - 8.22 times\n- 9 years - 9.33 times\n- For example, if you completed 7 years of service and your monthly basic pay + DA is Rs. 15,000/-, you can calculate your eligible withdrawal amount as (15000 x 7.13 = Rs. 1,06,950/-).",
  "- Nomination facility is available in EPF.\n- Nomination is required to settle the benefits in case of the death of the employee.\n- Employee can nominate either at the time of joining EPF or thereafter.\n- Employee can nominate his/her spouse, children, dependent parents, and the widow and children of an expired son. However, an employee cannot nominate brother or sister.\n- An employee who doesn't have a family can nominate any person. However, this nomination will become invalid once the employee gets married and acquires his/her family.\n- When an employee nominates multiple people, the percentage of sharing of benefits should be mentioned.

  "Before 1972, it was not compulsory for an employer to provide some reward to an employee when he leaves the organisation.But, in 1972, the Government of India came up with the Payment of Gratuity Act.As per this Act, if the employer is having more than 10 employees, then Gratuity is a compulsory benefit.Employers should pay Gratuity when the employee leaves the organisation after serving a certain number of years.",
  "When an employee joins an organization, he automatically becomes a part of the employer's Gratuity scheme.employer specifies the gratuity benefits on the Offer Letter given to the employee.employer contributes to the Gratuity fund on his own or through a life insurance company.When the employee leaves the organization after serving for at least 5 years, the employer pays the gratuity amount as a one-time lump sum amount appreciating the employee's service.If the employee leaves before 5 years, then the employee will not get any gratuity benefits.",

  "Gratuity is a one-time lump sum payment and it is paid to the employee when he leaves the organization after serving for at least 5 years of continuous service as an employee.\nThe reason for leaving the organization can be one of the following: \nResignation\n Laid off by the employer\n Voluntary retirement\n Retirement\n Disability due to accident or disease\n Death",
  "Gratuity benefit amount is calculated based on the following two things.\n\n1. Employees covered under Gratuity Act\nFor the employees covered under Gratuity Act, it is calculated using the following formula:\n\nGratuity = (number of years of service x last drawn monthly salary x 15) / 26\nwhere\n \n number of years of service\n is the total number of years of service of employee to the employer\n- if the employee's service is more than 6 months, then it will be considered as 1 year\n- if the employee's service is less than or equal to 6 months, then it will be ignored\n- For example, if the employee's service is 8 years and 7 months, then it will be considered as 9 years. If the employee's service is 8 years and 5 months, then it will be considered as 8 years only\n- Last drawn monthly salary is the amount employee received just before leaving the organisation\n- Monthly salary includes Basic Pay and DA (Dearness Allowance) only\n\n2. Employees NOT covered under Gratuity Act\nFor the employees who are NOT covered under Gratuity Act, it is calculated using the following formula:\n\nGratuity = (number of completed years of service x average monthly salary x 15) / 30\nwhere\n-number of completed years of service\" is the total number of completed years of service of employee to the employer\n- only the completed number of years will be considered. Any service in months will be ignored\n- For example, if the employee's service is 8 years and 10 months, then only 8 years will be considered\n- Average monthly salary is the average of last 10 months' salary just before leaving the organisation\n- Monthly salary includes Basic Pay, DA (Dearness Allowance), and commissions, if any, only",
  "There is an upper limit on the Gratuity benefit amount payable to the employees. The limit details are given below.\n\nGovernment Employees:\nThe limit is Rs. 20 Lakhs only. Earlier, the limit was Rs. 10 Lakhs. It was increased to Rs. 20 Lakhs with effective from 01-Jan-2016.\nBased on the calculations formulas mentioned in the previous section, if the Gratuity benefit is more than Rs. 20 Lakhs, the employer can pay a maximum of Rs. 20 Lakhs only as per the law.\nHowever, the employer can choose to pay the amount in excess of Rs. 20 Lakhs in the form of Bonus or other salary components.\n\nNon-Government Employees:\nThe limit is Rs. 20 Lakhs only.

Before that, the limit was Rs. 10 Lakhs only.\nRs. 20 Lakhs is the maximum tax free limit for an employee for his entire service. It may be from one employer or from many employers.\nIf any tax free Gratuity amount is already received, then the current limit will be reduced from Rs. 20 Lakhs to the extent of the gratuity received.\nFor example, let us assume that an employee has received Rs. 2 Lakhs as Gratuity benefit in the past. It means, in current and future employments, his eligible tax free limit will be Rs. 18 Lakhs only, not Rs. 20 Lakhs.\n\nb) Non-Government employees NOT covered under Gratuity Act:\nFor the non-Government employees NOT covered under the Payment of Gratuity Act, the Gratuity amount received will be tax free to a certain limit.actual gratuity received\n(number of completed years of service x average monthly salary x 15) / 30.\n Rs. 20 LakhsAny amount received more than the above mentioned limit will be added under the head Income from Salary and it will be taxed as per employee's income tax slab\n\nNote:\nThe limit of Rs. 20 Lakhs was effective from 29-Mar-2018 onwards.

  "There are certain situations where the employer will not pay gratuity to an employee even if the employee is eligible for gratuity.\nThe Employer can choose NOT to pay gratuity to an employee if he is laid off for reasons such as misconduct, violence, moral offence, causing damage to employer's properties, etc.",
  "Nomination facility is available in the Gratuity scheme.After 1 year of service, an employee can make a nomination with his employer to pay the Gratuity benefits just in case of his death before retirement.Nomination can be made in the name of one or more family members.Nominees should be family members only.
